# Project Overview 
This project focuses on analyzing the rivalries and alliances among Mexican cartels using Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs). The study investigates the structural and contextual factors influencing cartel rivalries, addressing key questions such as the impact of shared enemies, geographic overlap, and network centrality on rivalry formation.

The analysis is based on a dataset from Mexico’s Política de Drogas program, which includes information on cartel alliances, rivalries, and geographic operations. By leveraging ERGMs, the project captures the dependencies within the network and provides actionable insights for policymakers, law enforcement, and researchers to better understand cartel dynamics.
